Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

**Warning:** Recreational use of the Python standard library for HTTP may result in dangerous side-effects,
including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel,
constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.

Behold, the power of Requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_,
which is embedded within Requests.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000 downloads
every month. You don't want to be left out!
